<h1>Look to Income Share Agreement as a Way Out of Homelessness</h1>
<p>
    The options by which a person can pay their rent have remained fairly standard. One can either pay out-of-pocket, take a loan to meet rent, or rely on the government to pay the check for them. The massive growth in rents, loan rates, and competition for government subsidies have made housing insecurity a larger worry nationwide, with homelessness rapidly increasing in major cities like San Francisco and New York City. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Current discourse on affordable housing is primarily focused on the supply problem: there are too <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49458-harvard-theres-a-housing-shortage-and-its-eroding-affordability/">few homes</a> on the market. Leaning into this narrative, investment in the housing crisis has focused on building more housing units, with both city governments and private companies both <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/can-big-tech-solve-housing-crisis-politics-private-companies-taking-public-issues/">pledging</a> billions to increase housing supply. However this ignores the overall <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-State-of-Homelessness-in-America.pdf">half-a-million</a> housing insecure Americans who face homelessness not due to the lack of options, but because they cannot afford rents. 
    </p>
    <p>
    A similar problem is seen in education, with many low-income students unable to afford rising tuitions at private colleges. The challenge for them isn’t being accepted into elite universities, but finding a way to pay their fees. A solution known as an Income Share Agreement, originally proposed by Milton Friedman in the 1950s, is regaining popularity, having notably been offered by <a href=" https://studentloanhero.com/featured/schools-bachelors-income-share-agreements/">Purdue University</a> as an alternate way to pay for tuition. The broad strategy of these contracts can be translated into the housing space to provide a better opportunity for the homeless to find stable housing.
    </p>
    <p>
    An Income Share Agreement (ISA) is an alternate path to financing college education that treats education as an investment. <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-an-income-share-agreement-4687242">ISAs</a> outline a contract between the student and the school or a private investor, where the student receives tuition funds in exchange for paying a predefined percentage of their post-graduation salary for a set number of years. The biggest benefit of the agreement is that it allows students to avoid falling into crippling student loan debt, as repayments only occur once they are making a steady income. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Investors are making bets through these contracts on the future financial success of the students with whom they enter into ISAs. Based on their past experience & major choice, the investor predicts their expected post-graduation salary, which determines the income share percentage. The investor relies on the student’s future income to satisfy the upfront cost of tuition they have paid. This eliminates the initial financial barrier that many talented students face in entering elite yet expensive universities. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Similar to what exists in the education space, ISAs could be introduced to the housing market to reduce barriers for the homeless to rent. An agreement would occur between the tenant and a mixture of the city government, real estate investors, and the landlord itself. In exchange for paying for a year-long lease at the apartment, the investing party would assess the tenant’s prospects of reshaping their life by attaining a paying job; based on this likelihood, they would enter a contract defining the payment rate and time period that would only begin once the tenant secures a full-time job after the year-long lease has ended. 
    </p>
    <p>
    This plan’s success largely hinges on the fact that both parties have a financial stake in seeing the tenant succeed. With this agreement in place, the investing party may take greater measures to ensure that their tenant finds employment quickly. The apartment could provide job-training resources, interview preparation, and other rehabilitation measures like childcare assistance to aid in their tenant’s process of generating a steady income. The incentives for both parties in the contract become aligned in seeing the investment succeed, erasing the common criticism of housing vouchers as being handouts without any promise that they will adapt the beneficiary’s behavior. 
    </p>
    <p>
    A large barrier for the housing insecure to getting a job is their <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-golabek-goldman-homeless-address-job-application-20161010-snap-story.html">homeless status</a>; alongside pernicious credit reports and background checks, the consistent worry of finding shelter for the night hampers their ability to find employment. Even still, <a href="https://parade.com/643064/beckyhughes/working-homeless-population-grows-in-cities-across-the-u-s/">25%</a> of those homeless nationwide have a part-time or full-time job. ISAs would provide a permanent residence for these people, importantly giving them an valid, non-shelter address to list on job applications, which has historically been a factor of <a href=" https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5808&context=ylj">discrimination</a> in the hiring process. Moreover, with the stress of securing daily shelter alleviated, tenants can redirect their energies to improving their skills and finding a job, alongside utilizing any job-training resources the apartment provides.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally, ISAs are implementable immediately, since they would utilize existing housing complexes. A great deal of affordable housing investment is directed at building more homes. In San Francisco, a city notorious for its persistence of homelessness, 95% of the $600 billion housing bond raised through <a href=" https://www.spur.org/voter-guide/san-francisco-2019-11/prop-a-affordable-housing-bond ">Proposition A</a> in 2015 was used to create new housing units. However, it’s not simply about building more homes; without structural change in the renting process, these new units will simply go to the highest bidder and remain unaffordable for the housing insecure. ISAs provide homeless individuals a genuine opportunity to participate in the renting market without requiring additional land or investment.
    </p>
    <p>
    There would be a multitude of incentives for landlords to lease to tenants under ISAs. With a business model dedicated to a steady stream of revenue through monthly payments, apartment owners would continue to receive rent if the government or a private investor sponsors the ISA. However, with the <a href=" https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/san-francisco-real-estate-market/">median home price</a> in cities crippled by homelessness rising by $400,000 in the last five years, many landlords are running a significant surplus and may welcome an additional investment opportunity by sponsoring their tenant’s ISA themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
    The city government could help further incentivize landlords to rent to tenants under an ISA. The national <a href=" https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Landlord-Participation-Study-Final-Report.pdf">Housing Choice Voucher</a> program already provides $19 billion worth of subsidies to landlords who specifically rent their apartments to low-income individuals. Governments could similarly subsidize landlords who lease to homeless tenants that have signed onto an ISA using previously raised tax money for affordable housing purposes. Instilling financial purpose for apartment owners to participate will aid in larger scale adoption of these agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
    A more salient approach to resolving the homelessness crisis faced across America would be to introduce Income Share Agreements to the renting space. This would align the incentives of both tenants and landlords, while redirecting current spending towards a more fruitful endeavor.
